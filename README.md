# ecommerce-platform

Automated pipeline for an e-commerce platform

---

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a full-stack e-commerce platform with:
- A Node.js/Express backend API
- A React frontend
- Automated CI/CD using GitHub Actions
- Dockerization for both frontend and backend
- Cloud deployment on Render
- Live integration between frontend and backend

---

## Process & Steps

### 1. Repository & Directory Setup

Created a new GitHub repository and set up the project structure with separate directories for the backend (`api`) and frontend (`webapp`).

---

### 2. GitHub Integration

Connected the local project to GitHub for version control and collaboration.

### 3. Backend API Development

Initialized the backend API using Node.js and Express, created the main entry point (`index.js`), and added necessary scripts to the backendâ€™s `package.json`.

### 6. Dockerization

Created Dockerfiles for both the frontend and backend, built Docker images, and verified that both containers work as expected.

### 7. Deployment to Render

Deployed the application to Render, a cloud platform, and confirmed successful deployment.

### 8. Frontend-Backend Integration

Edited the React frontend to fetch products from the deployed backend API and redeployed the frontend.
